# Wikipedia Web Traffic Forecasting

A large-scale time-series forecasting project for predicting Wikipedia page
traffic using LightGBM, LSTM, and an ensemble modeling approach.

## Overview

This project explores machine learning and deep learning approaches for
forecasting Wikipedia web traffic across more than 145,000 pages.

The project includes data preprocessing, time-series feature engineering,
LightGBM and LSTM modeling, ensemble forecasting, model evaluation using
SMAPE, and comparison of forecasting performance across approaches.

## Models

### LightGBM

A gradient-boosting forecasting approach using engineered time-series
features and historical traffic information.

### LSTM

A recurrent neural network approach designed to learn temporal patterns
from historical page-traffic sequences.

### Ensemble

Predictions from the LightGBM and LSTM models were combined to evaluate
whether the complementary modeling approaches could improve forecasting
performance.

## Technologies

## Results

The repository contains prediction outputs for:

- LightGBM
- LSTM
- Ensemble model
- SMAPE evaluation

Detailed methodology, experiments, and results are available in the final
project report.

## Running the Project

The notebooks were originally developed and executed in Google Colab.

Some notebook cells therefore reference Google Drive paths such as:

`/content/drive/MyDrive/CSC480/Final Project/`

If running the notebooks locally or in another environment, update these
paths to match your local directory structure.

PDF exports of the notebooks with complete outputs are also included so
results can be reviewed without rerunning the models.

## Project Context

Developed as the final project for CSC 480 at the University of Arizona.
